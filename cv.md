#### About me:<br>
I'm a biotechnologist, and I'm disappointed with this choice. So, my goal - to become a programmer. I'm motivated and ready to work in this area, so I really like the profession of a programmer and I understand that this is mine. In particular, frontend development attracts me, and itâ€™s very important for me to get any knowledge in this area.

#### Technical Skills:
**Programming languages and technologies:** JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Redux, HTML, CSS<br>
**Programming practices:** Code review<br>
**Tools:** GIT, VS Code, Webpack, Gulp<br>
**Other skills:** work with image in Photoshop and Gimp

#### Code examples (selection sort at C++):

```C++
int *selection_sort(int *arr, int ptrlength) {
	for (int i = 0; i < ptrlength - 1; i++) {
		int min = i;
		for (int j = i + 1; j < ptrlength; j++) {
			if (arr[j] < arr[min]) {
				min = j;
			}
		}
		if (min != i) {
			swap(arr[i], arr[min]);
		}
	}
	return arr;
}
```
#### Education:
